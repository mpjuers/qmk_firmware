# The layout of mnosefish

This layout (like most), is based on the default layout and includes a tenkey and vim-like arrow layer with OSX text navigation shortcuts.

## The basics

Hold down `enter` for `rShift`; hold down `a` to access the arrow layer.
The tenkey is accessible from the `adjust` layer and the top-left key exits the tenkey.
Refer to the keymap for specific bindings.
